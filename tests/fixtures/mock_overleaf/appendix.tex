\section{Robustness Checks}
\label{app:robustness}

This appendix presents additional robustness checks for the results
reported in the main text.  We re-estimate the baseline specification
using alternative sample restrictions, different measures of educational
attainment, and an extended set of control variables.

\subsection{Alternative Sample Restrictions}

Table~\ref{tab:robustness} replicates the main findings when we
restrict the sample to countries with at least twenty years of
continuous data.  The point estimates remain stable across all three
estimators, suggesting that sample composition does not drive our
results.

\begin{table}[h!]

\caption{Robustness: Restricted Sample}
\label{tab:robustness}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Restriction & OLS & IV & Fixed Effects \\
\midrule
Baseline (42 countries)  & 0.12 & 0.14 & 0.11 \\
Balanced panel (28 countries) & 0.11 & 0.13 & 0.10 \\
OECD only (22 countries) & 0.10 & 0.12 & 0.09 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\textit{Notes:} See notes to Table~\ref{tab:main}.
\end{table}

\subsection{Alternative Measures of Education}

We also replace average years of schooling with the share of the adult
population that has completed secondary education.  The qualitative
conclusions are unchanged: returns remain positive, statistically
significant, and larger when identified by instrumental variables than
by OLS.
